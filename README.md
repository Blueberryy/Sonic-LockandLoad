# Sonic the Hedgehog in Doom
This is a Doom mod that replaces Doomguy with Sonic, including voice clips and a HUD sprite. Changes the weapons too.

## Okay, but… why?

I wanted to try my hand at Doom modding.

## How is it different from regular Doom?

Well...

- Doom Sonic moves a lot faster than Doomguy usually would, about 2 times as fast.

- The gameplay style is vastly divided from standard Doom, prioritising fast movement and agility over an arsenal of weapons.

- **Chaos Energy** is the only ammo type in the mod.

- ### RINGS!

## Weapons

### Unarmed
When you start out, you'll have Sonic's **Boost** and **Drift** techniques instead of the fist. These moves are for primarily  getting around the place, though it's also a good way of attacking, especially since you don't start with any weapons.
#### Boost
Pressing the primary attack button will initiate a forward Boost attack. If the attack comes into contact with an enemy, it'll deal a high amount of damage. This attack requires 15 Chaos Energy to use.
> If you try to Boost with less than 15 Chaos Energy, you will Dash instead, dealing less damage.
#### Drift
Holding down the secondary attack button will initiate the Drift, moving you forwards at high speeds. If you come into contact with an enemy, you'll deal damage gradually.


### Speedy shotgun
Later on, you can get the **speedy shotgun**, which is a super fast shotgun that lacks reloading and might as well be the chaingun. (which is why I removed the chaingun) Doom II chaingunners be damned.
#### Primary fire
The primary fire is a quick shotgun blast. Holding down the button allows rapid fire. Like **rapid** fire. Uses 2 Chaos Energy per shot.
#### Secondary fire
The secondary fire is a five-shot burst fire with a wider spread. Deals more damage, but uses 8 Chaos Energy for each shot, 40 for the whole attack.


### Chaos Blaster
The **Chaos Blaster** is simply Doom's plasma rifle, but a lot faster. You can find them wherever chainguns usually appear.
#### Primary fire
Simply fires a beam of plasma shots. I say beam because the projectiles come out a lot faster than the usual plasma rifle. Uses 10 Chaos Energy per shot.
#### Secondary fire
The Chaos Blaster currently has no altfire. If you have any ideas, suggestions are available in [issues](https://github.com/CutieGorlAstrid/sonicdoom/issues).


## Difficulty levels

The first difficulty in this mod is **Fast Track**. This has **Easy spawn levels** but monsters have **three times more health**. You also take a **quarter of the damage** you would usually take.

The middle difficulty is **Let's do this!** This has **Normal spawn levels** and monsters have **six times more health**. You also take  **0.125 more damage** than you usually would.

The hard difficulty, **Speed Incarnate**, is where you really have to get serious. **Hard spawn levels**, you take **double damage**, and monsters have **12 times** their usual health.

And just because I could, I included the standard Doom **Ultra-Violence**! This has nothing changed from Doom. Which also means you're stupidly overpowered against the denizens of Hell.

And the final difficulty… you know what? Don't do this one. It's for your own good.
