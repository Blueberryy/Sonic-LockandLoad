## Playing a pre-release version
At the top of the page, click `Code`, then `Download ZIP`.<br>
Run `Sonic-LockandLoad-main.zip` with GZDoom.<br>
Optionally, you can rename `Sonic-LockandLoad-main.zip` to `Sonic-LockandLoad-main.pk3`.

## Does this mod support multiplayer?
No, for multiple reasons:

- The purpose of this mod is single player only.
- The weapons are way too unbalanced for multiplayer. Try it and see.
- The ACS crap I've done makes multiplayer hard to achieve.
- Every character will just look like Doomguy, because I haven't bothered to make sprites for the player character.
