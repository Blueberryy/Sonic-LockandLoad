# Sonic the Hedgehog in Doom
This is a Doom mod that replaces Doomguy with Sonic, including voice clips and a HUD sprite. Changes the weapons too.

## Okay, but… why?

I wanted to try my hand at Doom modding.

## How is it different from regular Doom?

Well...

- Doom Sonic moves a lot faster than Doomguy usually would, about 2 times as fast.

- ### RINGS!

- Doomguy's regular weapons have been replaced by faster variants that consume a ton of ammo.

- There's **no pistol.**

- The fist is way more useful, so much so that the chainsaw is now obsolete.

- There's only one ammo type. All your weapons eat through it so fast you'll wonder where it all went.

- Oh, yeah, the menu's different too. Supposed to resemble Sonic Adventure 2.

- There's no BFG, because if we made a rapid-fire BFG then the game would feel too unbalanced.

- Difficulty levels that are actually really freaking hard. Ultra-Violence is the easiest difficulty! And good luck trying to complete the hardest.

- Knee-Deep in the Dead's maps all have music tracks from Sonic Forces. The Shores of Hell, Inferno and Hell on Earth don't yet have any music replaced.

## Weapons

Your first weapon in the game is **Sonic's Fist**. The speed of the attack is so fast you have no use for the chainsaw.

You also start out with the **Chaos Blaster**. This is… just a faster plasma rifle. I don't have the knowledge or time to create custom sprites.

Later on, you can get the **Speedy Shotgun**, which is a super fast autoshotty that doesn't need to reload. It uses a whole load of ammo.

There's also the **Chaos Rain** cannon. If you thought the regular chaingun was fast… oh boy. Do I have news for you.

And finally, the **Rocket Stream** launcher. This weapon is stupidly OP but it eats through ammo like a drill through dirt. Good luck not blowing yourself up.

## Difficulty levels

The easiest difficulty in this mod is **Ultra-Violence**. No, I'm not joking. With how OP your speed and weapons are, this will seem like a cake walk.

Next up is **Fast Track**. This has **Easy spawn levels** but monsters have **three times more health**. You also take a **quarter of the damage** you would usually take.

The middle difficulty is **Let's do this!** This has **Normal spawn levels** and monsters have **six times more health**. You also take  **0.125 more damage** than you usually would.

The hard difficulty, **Speed Incarnate**, is where you really have to get serious. **Hard spawn levels**, you take **double damage**, and monsters have **12 times** their usual health.

And the final difficulty… you know what? Don't do this one. It's for your own good.
