# Welcome to Sonic: Lock and Load! ![GitHub all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/SpeedStriker243/sonicdoom/total)
*Sonic: Lock and Load* is a DOOM mod for the GZDoom source port based on Sonic the Hedgehog.
Includes player classes, weapons, items and certain techniques.

## Playing a release version
Release versions are [here](https://github.com/That1M8Head/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases). Considering that the currently unstable Chaos Update is VASTLY different from any release so far, this is not recommended.

## Playing an unstable (non-release) version
At the top of the page, click `Code`, then `Download ZIP`.<br>
Run `Sonic-LockandLoad-main.zip` with GZDoom.<br>
Optionally, you can rename `Sonic-LockandLoad-main.zip` to `Sonic-LockandLoad-main.pk3`.

## Does this mod support multiplayer?
No, for multiple reasons:

- The purpose of this mod is single player only.
- The weapons are way too unbalanced for multiplayer. Try it and see.
- The ACS crap I've done makes multiplayer hard to achieve.
- Every character will just look like Doomguy, because I haven't bothered to make sprites for the player character.
- This mod uses ZScript, so it's incompatible with Zandronum.
- GZDoom is not intended for multiplayer.

## Known issues
### All versions
- **Sonic's Boost feels sluggish and goes slower than it should**
    - This indicates a problem with your GZDoom config. (I'm not sure which problem that is specifically.) One way of fixing this is to delete your `gzdoom.ini` configuration file, launch GZDoom, and reconfigure everything.
### Chaos Update
- **The mod doesn't work with a specific map**
    - This is an issue I've noticed with the Chaos Update, but I've no idea what causes it.
- **The mod displays a message about an incompatible mod**
    - [Then don't run this mod with Brutal Doom.](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=47678)
