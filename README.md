### *Sonic: Lock & Load* is a Sonic the Hedgehog-based platforming-focused first-person shooter on the GZDoom source port, i.e. a DOOM semi-total conversion that *requires DOOM 2's IWAD*.

It's not really based on any kind of Sonic game in particular, instead taking inspiration from the entire franchise.

Sonic: Lock & Load is inspired by the entire Sonic the Hedgehog series of games, Sonic Robo Blast 2, DOOM Eternal, ULTRAKILL, various GZDoom mods and various classic FPS games.

The current stable version of Sonic: Lock & Load is **v1.3.3**, though it's recommended you play the **v1.4 Final Final Demo** instead.

**Have any suggestions for or problems with the mod?** Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/issues/new/choose), it'll probably be resolved soon if possible.

To play an unstable version of S:L&L, use `git clone` to clone it to your computer, and open the cloned repo with GZDoom, like you would with a WAD or PK3. You can update with `git pull`. **Unstable versions contain unfinished stuff, the latest demo is recommended.**
